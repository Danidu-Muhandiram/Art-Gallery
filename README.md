# NOIR ATLAS - Personal Art Gallery 🎨

**NOIR ATLAS** is my personal online art gallery where I share a curated collection of original AI-generated artworks and illustrations.
Each artwork is refined into high-resolution wallpapers and atmospheric background designs. Some of my works are published on stock platforms, and selected pieces are shared here for free personal use.
Every release is designed to look clean and balanced on all screen sizes - from mobile phones to ultra-wide monitors 🖥️📱
The website is built with Next.js and focuses on a cinematic layout, smooth motion, and minimal design so the artwork remains the main focus ✨
