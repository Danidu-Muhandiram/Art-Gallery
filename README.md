# NOIR ATLAS - Personal Art Gallery 🎨

**NOIR ATLAS** is a personal art gallery featuring a curated collection of my original **AI artworks and illustrations**, refined into high-resolution wallpapers and atmospheric background plates, with selected works shared here freely for personal use alongside my stock-published designs.

Each release is crafted for crisp, balanced viewing across portrait and landscape screens - from mobile devices to ultra-wide monitors 🖥️📱

Built with Next.js, the experience focuses on cinematic presentation, editorial layout, and subtle motion to let the artwork take center stage ✨
